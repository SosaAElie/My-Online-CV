                        from CUNY Hunter College with a BA in Biochemistry and a strong interest in CS.
                        I also graduated from the NYU Tandon School of Engineering Tandon Bridge program with a Certificate of Distinction.
                        My aim is to incorporate my knowledge of CS, specifically my knowledge of Python and JavaScript into my
                        workflow to improve efficiency.
